# Storm Launcher

Controls the Dream Cheeky [O.I.C Storm](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/storm-oic-missile-launcher) & [Thunder](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/thunder-missile-launcher) USB Missile Launchers.  

There are a few projects for using older launchers in Linux, but I couldn't find any for this launcher, so... enjoy.

This script requires PyUSB 1.0+, apt in Debian/Ubuntu installs 0.4.

It also requires that you run it as root unless you want to spend an afternoon playing with udev rules :/

## Getting Started:

    git clone git@github.com:nmilford/stormLauncher.git
    cd stormLauncher
    chmod +x stormLauncher.py
    sudo ./

## Usage:

* Use w, s, a and d to aim.
* Use left-shift to fire.
